# 2. Working with outliers

## Outliers to be expected
## Outliers can reflect genuine properties of variable, or experimental error 
##   (e.g. measurement error)
## Can have major effect on slope of regression lines
## Possible to remove outliers, or use "robust statistics", e.g. Median is 
##   consider robust, mean not; non-parametric more robust
## Possible that outliers caused by samples being multiple, distinct 
##   sub-populations (e.g. impact of other variable)


## Should be wary of removing outliers without good reason
## See Stats 5 for plots and residual plots which help indicate outliers
##    and how influential they are likely to be
## Outliers don't necessarily indicate bad data
